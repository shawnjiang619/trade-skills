# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project overview

Personal options trading Claude Code plugin marketplace. Contains one plugin (`trade`) wrapping one skill (`trade`) — a multi-leg options trading assistant backed by a curated pitfalls library and case-study archive.

## Repository structure

This repo is a Claude Code plugin marketplace. Skills are organized under `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill>/` following the [`himself65/finance-skills`](https://github.com/himself65/finance-skills) convention.

```

## How the skill works

`SKILL.md` defines the trigger description and lists the lazy-loaded reference files under `references/`. The model only reads individual `references/pitfalls/NN-*.md` or `references/ticker/<name>.md` files when a specific trade situation calls for them — keeping the entry-point context small.

### SKILL.md format

```markdown
---
name: trade
description: >
  Multi-line description that doubles as the trigger definition.
  Include specific phrases, keywords, and scenarios that should activate this skill.
---

# Skill Title

Step-by-step instructions, structure-to-regime quick reference, and the lazy-load index.

## Reference Files

- `references/strategies.md` — always-relevant framework
- `references/pitfalls/README.md` — index of 24 pitfalls
- `references/ticker/README.md` — index of case studies
```

**Required frontmatter fields:** `name`, `description`. The `description` controls when the skill activates — write it as a comprehensive trigger list, not a summary.

## Adding to the knowledge base

- **New pitfall**: copy `plugins/trade/skills/trade/references/pitfalls/_template.md` → `pitfalls/NN-slug.md`, then add a row to `pitfalls/README.md`
- **New case study**: copy `plugins/trade/skills/trade/references/ticker/_template.md` → `ticker/<ticker>-YYYY-MM.md`, then add a row to `ticker/README.md`
- **Strategy update**: edit `references/strategies.md` directly — flat by design
- **Skill description tweak**: edit the YAML `description` field in `SKILL.md` frontmatter (controls what triggers the skill)

## Plugin system

- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — marketplace listing.
- `plugins/trade/plugin.json` — plugin manifest (name, version, keywords). Skills under `plugins/trade/skills/` with SKILL.md frontmatter are auto-discovered.

Users install via:

```bash
npx plugins add shawnjiang619/trade-skills
```

When a skill is invoked as a plugin, it is namespaced as `<plugin-name>:<skill-name>` (e.g., `/trade:trade`).

## Important constraints

- **No trade execution.** All advice in this skill is read-only analysis. Never generate code that places trades.
- **Market data priority:** Use the local **Bloomberg Terminal via `xbbg`** FIRST (raw pulls + the `C:\blp\data\bbg_trade.py` helper for spot/GEX/max-pain/IV-Rank/flow-proxy). Use the **TradingView desktop reader** (`finance-data-providers:tradingview-reader`) as a secondary source, notably for weeklies (Bloomberg `opt_chain` returns monthlies + LEAPS only). Do **not** use Funda AI, yfinance, web search, or guesses when Bloomberg can answer. State coverage gaps (social/Reddit/X sentiment, Polymarket, congressional trades, earnings-call transcripts, curated smart-money flow) as unavailable rather than fabricating.
